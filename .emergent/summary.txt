The AI engineer successfully progressed the apebrain.cloud application, iteratively building out features and resolving critical bugs. Initial work focused on product image uploads and strengthening admin panel security against client-side bypasses. Significant new features included configurable Instagram links on various pages, dynamic toggles for landing page buttons, and a comprehensive multimedia blog section with video/audio embeds and an AI image fetching system. Challenges included persistent MongoDB serialization errors, PayPal checkout validation issues, and React  double calls, all effectively resolved. The text-to-speech feature was implemented but later removed due to user feedback and headless browser limitations. The latest work centered on a robust order management system, integrating PayPal, email notifications for customers, and detailed tracking functionalities with DHL, along with admin controls for order status and deletion. The development process consistently involved user feedback, backend and frontend testing, and environment setup.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was finalizing the order management system. Specifically, the last task was to implement a mechanism for the administrator to receive a notification when a customer's order status is updated to delivered. This involved updating the backend () to include the logic for sending an email notification to the admin upon a delivered status change. The AI engineer successfully added this functionality and was in the process of restarting the backend server to apply these changes. This completes the full loop of order status management and notifications, ensuring the admin is informed at key stages, particularly for package delivery.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the newly implemented admin delivery notification feature.
